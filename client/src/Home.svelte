        <h1>What is Blef?</h1>
        <p>Blef is a Polish card game, based on deceiving other players. Best played face to face or with Facecams.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="game-info-container">
        <p>1. There is a standard deck of 52 cards in game.</p>
        <p>2. At the start of the game each players gets 1 random card.</p>
        <p>
            3. One it is Your turn during the round, there are 2 possible moves: Raise and Check.
            <br /> <br />
            Raise - You can choose a Hand Ranking, for example Pair of Aces.
            <br />
            That means that you bet there are 2 Aces among ALL dealt cards in current round.
            <br />
            New bet must have higher ranking than previous bet.
            <br /><br />
            Check - You can check previous player's bet.
            <br />
            If his bet was correct then You will be the one to receive another card.
            <br />
            If his bet was incorrect then previous player will receive additional card and another he will begin next round.
            <br />
            For example if previous player bets there is One King and You check it and there are no dealt kings in current round => Previous Player loses that round.
        </p>
        <p>4. Player is eliminated once he loses a round with 5 cards.</p>
        <p>5. There can be maximum 5 players in 1 game.</p>
        <p>6. There is a 45 second timer for each turn during a round. If it ends a move is made automaticaly.</p>
        <p>7. The ranking of a selected bet directly responds to this list (same list will be available in game):</p>
        <ul class="hand-rankings">
            {#each handRankings as ranking}
                <li>
                    <span>{ranking.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + ranking.slice(1)}</span>
                    <br />
                    <img src="{cardImageHandler.getCardImage(ranking)}" alt="{ranking}" />
                </li>
            {/each}
